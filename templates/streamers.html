          As I have said numerous times, League of Legends is an extraordinarily popular game. This also
          extends to the streaming community. On Twitch.tv, people who are either very good at the game,
          are very funny, or have some other quality that makes them watchable, may stream the game to
          any number of viewers.

          <br>Most of these streamers however, are male. The top streamers of the game, Tyler1, imaqtpie, Yassuo, Shiphtur, etc,
          are all males. There are female streamrs, like Pokimane and Emiru, but their numbers generally don't
          even come close to that of the male streamers.

          <br>One streamer in particular, Tyler1, is often considered as the face of the streaming community.
          With an all-time highest viewer count of almost 350,000, it's easy to see why. What's interesting
          with regard to the topic, is his attitude. Tyler1, or as he more commonly refers to himself, T1, has made
          a name for himself by being exceptionally loud, rude, and alltogether moronic on his channel. The most popular
          clips on his channel consist of him screaming at the mic while running around in circles, or beating his desk in rage.
          His catchphrase, uttered every chance he gets, is "T1 alpha as fuck". In short T1 is, in some ways, the
          very definition of toxic masculinity.

          <br>Regardless, not every streamers is like this. Most simply play the game at
          a very high level, which is what attracts their viewers. It is important to note the general
          demographic that tend to hit the highest viewer counts however.
