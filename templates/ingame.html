          Although League of Legends does not require a purchase to play, those that enjoy the game may
          choose to spend extra money on cosmetic features such as skins for the many different champions in the
          game. Some of these, champions and skins, are extremely over-sexualized.

          <br> Riot had actually recently made a promise to stop over-sexualizing characters when there was no
          reason to do so. Shortly after, they released <a href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/champions/Kaisa/"> Kai'sa</a>
          Kai'sa, according to here lore, was abandoned in the Void, a nightmarish hellscape full of demons and other monsters, ever since she was a child.
          However, in-game, she speaks perfect english, for some reason.

          <br> There is also the issue of cosmetics. I can't possibly list all of them here since their are so many, but it is safe
          to say that a fair amount of them are overly sexualized.

          <br>In any case, the oversexualization of so many of the game's characters and cosmetics leads me to believe
          that the culture at riot tends to promote this sort of thing. This is also probably not helped by the fact
          that every champion for the past seven years has had a male design lead.
