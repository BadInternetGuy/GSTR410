          In 2018, the popular online news site Kotaku, interviewed 28 current and former employees of
          Riot Games. The interview concerned alleged gender discrimination at the game's headquarters.
          Those being interviewed spoke of everything from being payed less, all the way to sexual harrassment.

          <br>Then, in 2019, five current and former employees of Riot Games brought lawsuits against the company.
          Riot responded by filing motions to force two of these employees into private arbitrations. For context,
          in a private arbitration, there is no judge or jury, which makes it significantly harder for a company
          to be held accountable for their actions.

          <br>In response to this, over 150 women from the company walked out in protest recently. They promised
          that they would resort to other means if Riot chose to do nothing.

          <br>In any case, Riot responded with a post on their official blog page. It can be found <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/who-we-are/our-first-steps-forward">here</a>.
          The blog mainly speaks about Riot's commitment to do better from now on in the interest of inclusivity. It also apologizes to everyone involved.
          Overall, I would say it is a step forward to at least admit what went wrong.

          <br>However, there was more controversy to be had after this affair. At the popular gaming convention
          PAX West, Riot decided to host several panels that were to be completely closed to men, and only men.
          Only women and non-binary folk were allowed to attend. The forums went absolutely berserk with this info,
          stating that this was simply inequality in the opposite direction.

          <br> One rioter in particular, Daniel Z. Klein, was incredibly rude to fans of the game when interacting with
          them on Twitter. You can read more about those particular incidents <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/7/17827796/riot-games-employee-depart-women-only-pax-west-event">here</a>.
