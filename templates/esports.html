          Although League of Legends is an extremely popular game by millions who play it casually, it also
          has an enormous competitive E-sports scene surrounding it. Every year, the best teams from each region
          compete in an enormous tournament, called Worlds, to see who is the best. The winner of this tournament
          takes home millions in prize money, and each member of the team is immortalized in the game itself
          with skins they design themselves.

          <br> What is significant about the Esports side of things, is that there are literally no female players
          on any team. Vaevictus Gaming was around for a small length of time, but were effectively set up to fail right
          from the very start. In short they were nothing more than a publicity stunt.

          <br>Even when speaking about those that cast the many different games, there are only three female employees
          involved. Ovilee, Sjokz, and Froskurinn, as they are known, are the only female employees that are
          commonly involved in the professional side of League of Legends. Even in this case, only Froskurinn ever casts
          any of the more important games. Ovilee and Sjokz mainly exist to interview the many different players and
          coaches.
